hi there!!!
 I'm excited to share that I’ve just completed my "first Testing project"!

📘 Project Name: Dictionary Lookup App
 🧪 Testing Type: Manual Functional Testing
 🛠️ Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript + Free Dictionary API

As someone who’s just starting out in the QA field, I wanted to try learning by doing. So I created a simple dictionary app and tested it like a real tester would — and honestly, I learned a lot through the process.
🔍 What I did:
-Built a small app where you can enter any word and get its meaning from an API.
-Manually tested the app to check how it works with valid and invalid words, how it looks on different screens, and how the buttons and results behave.
Wrote proper test cases in a document — including steps, expected vs. actual results, and pass/fail status.
-Found a small bug during testing and documented it in a bug report.
-Created a short final test summary with what worked well and what didn’t.

📌 What I learned:
-How to write test cases clearly from scratch.
-Why it’s important to think like both a user and a tester.
-How to report bugs properly and summarize the testing work in a neat way.

📝 I’ve made a complete test case document — happy to share it if anyone wants to see how I did it.

This was a small project, but for me, it was a big step! I'm now exploring API testing, automation, and testing tools to keep improving.
Thanks for reading . Let’s connect if you’re also into testing or tech — I’d love to learn together!
